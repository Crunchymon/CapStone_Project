# Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository showcases my Capstone Project, a comprehensive initiative designed to emulate the process of developing a professional-level project from inception to completion. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the various stages of project development, the importance of meticulous planning, and the iterative processes required to produce a refined and polished outcome.

## Key Learnings
1. **Project Layout**: Emphasized the importance of structured planning and organization to ensure a seamless development process.
2. **Iteration Process**: Highlighted that achieving high-quality results often requires multiple refinements and iterations.
3. **Responsive Design**: Developed skills in creating websites that adapt efficiently to different devices, enhancing usability and accessibility.
4. **GitHub Proficiency**: Improved familiarity with GitHub for version control, collaboration, and project management.
5. **Website Hosting**: Mastered deploying websites using Netlify, making projects accessible online with ease.

## Features
- Real-world project development with practical applications.
- Implementation of responsive web design techniques.
- Iterative improvement strategies for better performance and quality.

## Technologies Used
